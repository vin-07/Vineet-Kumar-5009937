1. Understand the Problem
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms
Efficient data storage and retrieval are crucial in handling large inventories because:

Performance: Efficient data structures and algorithms ensure quick access, modification, and storage of data.

Scalability: Proper data structures handle large amounts of data without performance degradation.

Memory Management: Optimized data structures utilize memory efficiently, preventing waste and improving speed.
Suitable Data Structures

ArrayList: Good for dynamic arrays, allowing for fast access and modification. However, it can be slow for deletions and insertions not at the end.

HashMap: Provides average O(1) time complexity for add, update, and delete operations. Suitable for fast lookups by key (e.g., productId).


2. Setup: Create a New Project
We'll create a new Java project for the inventory management system.


3. Implementation
We'll define a Product class and use a HashMap to store the products. We'll implement methods to add, update, and delete products from the inventory.


Analysis
Time Complexity

Add Product: O(1) on average, as HashMap provides constant-time performance for insertion.

Update Product: O(1) on average, as HashMap allows for fast updates using the product ID as the key.

Delete Product: O(1) on average, as HashMap provides constant-time performance for deletion by key.


Optimization

Using a HashMap is already an efficient choice for this problem due to its average O(1) time complexity for basic operations. However, optimization can focus on:

Ensuring productId is unique and efficiently hashed to minimize collisions.
Regularly cleaning up unused entries to maintain performance and manage memory effectively.
