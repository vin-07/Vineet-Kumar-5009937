1. Understand Asymptotic Notation

Big O Notation
Big O notation is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Specifically, it focuses on the worst-case scenario and helps in analyzing how the running time or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size grows.

Best Case: The minimum time an algorithm takes to complete.

Average Case: The expected time an algorithm takes to complete, averaged over all possible inputs.

Worst Case: The maximum time an algorithm takes to complete.


Scenarios for Search Operations
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1) (when the element is at the beginning)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n) (when the element is at the end or not present)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1) (when the middle element is the target)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)
2. Setup
Let's create a Product class with attributes productId, productName, and category.



3. Implementation
We'll implement both linear and binary search algorithms. We'll store products in an array for linear search and a sorted array for binary search.


Analysis

Time Complexity
Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)


Suitability for the Platform
Linear Search: Suitable for small datasets or when the list is unsorted. It's simple to implement but can be inefficient for large datasets.

Binary Search: More suitable for large datasets, provided the list is sorted. It significantly reduces the number of comparisons, making it much faster for large datasets.
